# Developers

Land developers will find, or assemble, large parcels of land and then develop
this area as they'd like, including building an internal road network and plot
setup.

# Zoning

Zones are not done by what is allowed, but by what is not allowed. Zones are a maximum building height, maximum floor areas for retail / service / office units, and a set of things that are not allowed (e.g. industrial buildings)

# Contracts

When building a city service building, or a large road project, the project
will be opened up for bids. The player can then decide on which bid to accept.
The bids would typically be from three different bidders, one expensive but
very high quality, one moderate cost and moderate quality, and one for lowest
cost and low quality. The quality will not be shown to the player directly.

# City Government Policy

The city government will have elections and will vote upon policies. The player
cannot change these votes or suggest policies. The player will have to deliver
on these policies. Some will be local policies - e.g. mandatory pre-school
education for all - some will be regional policies - e.g. airport needed in
your city - some will be national policies - e.g. freeway needs going through
your city.

# Regional settlements

The map will be pre-populated with multiple settlements - based on Christallers
theory or a grid of settlements (US). These settlements can join your city, if
you help provide them with enough services, or refuse to join.
